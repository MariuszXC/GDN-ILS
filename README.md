# GDN-ILS
Adding ILS - test

This is a test of adding additional nav aids to an airport in FlightGear. As an example EPGD was chosen.
The Airports and Terrain directories contains a copy of TerraSync'ed files from TerraSync cache.

Navdata/nav/nav.dat contains both (some of) original definitions (copied from fgdata/Navaids/nav.dat.gz), as well as ones added for testing.

Relevant data format is defined in XP-NAV810-Spec.pdf available online.
